This is the DKC Stage Name Editor which can be used to edit the stage names of Donkey Kong Country. Editing stage names doesn't use any extra space so this also works with hacks. A 1.0 U Rom will be required for this program to work. Once done, the editor will create a new copy of your ROM (your original file will be left untouched)!

FEATURES:
	Smart saving - This program can tell when a change has been made. Therefore, it warns you if you try to exit with unsaved changes. Also, you are only allowed to save when a change has been made.
	Smart ROM reading - This program recognizes when it is viewing a ROM that was previously edited by this program. For this reason, no repeat work is necessary.
	Minimal Editing - This program modifies a very small amount of the game's code, and the edited part is the stage name part. Therefore, this program is 100% safe to use on various hacks.
	Quick edit - Minor, but you can press Enter in any textbox to get the same effect as clicking the associated button.
